## nRF52832 Boards
The nRF52832 does not have on-chip USB support.  As such, you need to use the on board serial adapter to connect your computer to the nRF52832 for flashing a new firmware.  Depending on whether your hardware has on-board serial or not, you will need a serial USB adapter.  Note that the hardware is +3.3V.  As such, a standard +5V serial adapter may damage the nRF52 processor.

On reboot, the Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader briefly listens to the serial UART for a firmware upgrade connection.  Note that unlike for the nRF52840, the bootloader does not provide for a "double-reset" trigger to go (and remain) into firmware upgrade mode.  Because of the very brief period in which the bootloader listens for a firmware update, it is recommended to use a controller which has the serial adapter on-board with the necessary reset circuitry installed.  This circuitry connects the DTR line from the serial chip to the reset line through a capacitor. See the circuit diagram for the [Adafruit Feather nrf52832](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/052/793/original/microcontrollers_revgsch.png?1523067417) for an example of such circuitry.

### Serial Upload using Arduino IDE
This step assumes you have the firmware already initialized and downloaded from the [BlueMicro Builder](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/BlueMicro_Builder) Github actions tool.  You need the entire repository and not the artifact generated by the github action.
- Start the Arduino IDE
- Open the firmware
- Select the board from the Arduino IDE "Tools -> Board" Menu
- Connect your keyboard. A new serial port should show up in the "Tools -> Port" menu. 
- Select the serial port of your keyboard in the "Tools -> Port" menu. 
- Compile your keyboard using the ✔️ button in the toolbar
- Flash (upload) your keyboard using the ➡️ button in the toolbar


### SWD Upload
If you do not have an on-board serial adapter that triggers the reset circuitry, it may be easier to flash the nRF52832 using a SWD programmer.  At this point, this upload method is not considered "easy" from a setup point of view as the methods differs between SWD programmers.  You can use the hex or bin files provided as part of the github action artifact.

## nRF52840 Boards
The Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader supports both serial and UF2 flashing for nRF52840 chips.

### Using UF2 Upload Method

This step assumes you have the firmware already initialized and compiled using the [BlueMicro Builder](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/BlueMicro_Builder) Github actions tool.  You just need to download the GitHub Actions artifact and uncompress the artifact zip file. It will contain the UF2 file you need.

- Have your UF2 file ready
- Connect your keyboard to your computer
- A new "drive" should show up for your keyboard
- Copy (drag/drop) the UF2 file to this drive
- Once the copy is complete, the keyboard will reset automatically.  This may cause the operating system to give you a error (failed to copy) as it won't have access to the drive anymore to verify that the copy was successful.  This is OK: the firmware has been flashed.


### Using Serial Upload Method and Arduino Tooling

This step assumes you have the firmware already initialized and downloaded from the [BlueMicro Builder](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/BlueMicro_Builder) Github actions tool.  You need the entire repository and not the artifact generated by the github action.

- Start the Arduino IDE
- Open the firmware
- Select the board from the Arduino IDE "Tools -> Board" Menu
- Connect your keyboard. A new serial port should show up in the "Tools -> Port" menu. Note that you may need to "double-reset" your board to be able to select the correct serial port.
- Select the serial port of your keyboard in the "Tools -> Port" menu. 
- Compile your keyboard using the ✔️ button in the toolbar
- Flash (upload) your keyboard using the ➡️ button in the toolbar
