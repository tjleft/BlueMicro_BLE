There are plenty on the list of keyboards all added by the community for others to benefit.

You can use the configuration files for these keyboards as a starting point for your own.

For the latest list of keyboards with configurations available, see [here](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/BlueMicro_BLE/tree/master/firmware/keyboards)

The process to add your own keyboard is quite simple. All you need to edit is 4 files. See how [here](adding_keyboard.md).
